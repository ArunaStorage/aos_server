# TODO

- [ ] Start custom relation types at idx 20, to reserve internal relation idx's
- [ ] Fix Author identifier


- [ ] Add hooks, create a generic workflow / workflow executions table 
- [ ] Decide if workflow runs are part of the graph ?

- [ ] Check that groups are associated with a realm when creating projects
